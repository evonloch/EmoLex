The film opens with a large bat flying into a medieval castle
The bat circles the room before suddenly changing into Mephistopheles an incarnation of the Devil
Mephistopheles produces a cauldron and an assistant who helps him conjure a woman from the cauldron
The room is cleared shortly before two cavaliers enter
The devil s assistant pokes their backs before instantaneously transporting to different areas of the room confusing the pair and causing one to flee
The second stays and has several other tricks played on him such as furniture being moved around and the sudden appearance of a skeleton
The cavalier is unfazed using a sword to attack the skeleton which then turns into a bat then into Mephistopheles who conjures four spectres to subdue the man
Recovering from the spectres attack the man is visibly dazed and is brought the woman from the cauldron who impresses him with her beauty
Mephistopheles then turns her into a withered old crone in front of the man s eyes then again into the four spectres
The second cavalier returns and after a brief show of bravery flees again this time by leaping over the balcony s edge
After the spectres disappear the cavalier is confronted face to face by the Devil before reaching for and brandishing a large crucifix which causes the devil to vanish
